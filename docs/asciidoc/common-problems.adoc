== Answers to common questions and problems

[[q1]]*Q. Why does springfox ignore the http status code in the return value of a controller method?*

A. https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/822#issuecomment-117372109[Reference #822]

[[q2]]*Q. What is the relationship between swagger-ui and springfox-swagger-ui?*

A. It can be a little confusing:

- Swagger Spec is a specification.
- Swagger Api - an implementation of that specification that supports jax-rs, restlet, jersey etc.
- Springfox libraries in general - another implementation of the specification focused on the spring based ecosystem.
- Swagger.js and Swagger-ui - are client libraries in javascript that can consume swagger specification.
- springfox-swagger-ui - the one that you're referring to, is just packaging swagger-ui in a convenient way so that
spring services can serve it up.

[[q3]]*Q. I use GSON and don't use Jackson, What should I do?*

A. Thanks to https://github.com/chrishuttonch[@chrishuttonch] for describing the solution to https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/867[this issue]

TIP: I switched on the excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation() which meant that none of the objects would produce any data. To get around this I created several serializers for the following classes:

[source,java]
----
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.service.ApiListing.class, new SwaggerApiListingJsonSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.spring.web.json.Json.class, new SwaggerJsonSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.SwaggerResource.class, new SwaggerResourceSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.service.ResourceListing.class, new SwaggerResourceListingJsonSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.SwaggerResource.class, new SwaggerResourceSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.SecurityConfiguration.class, new SwaggerSecurityConfigurationSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.UiConfiguration.class, new SwaggerUiConfigurationSerializer());
----

[[q4]]*Q. ObjectMapper weirdness in a spring-boot app?*

A. It is possible you're experiencing one of the following issues

. NPE During startup?
[NOTE]
Running in debugger revealed that I had two instances of WebApplicationInitializers in my war. Spring is
refreshing context with each one and is resulting in second instance of `OptimizedModelPropertiesProvider` without
`onApplicationEvent` call. I was able to fix it by removing second `WebApplicationInitializer` in my code. Seems this is
related to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/221[spring-boot issue #221] footnote:[Thanks to https://github.com/shasti421[@shasti421]]

. Object Mapper Customizations Not Working?
[NOTE]
Sometimes there are multiple `ObjectMapper` in play and it may result in the customizations not working
footnote:[thanks https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1140[Jaap-van-Hengstum]] Spring Boot in `HttpMessageConverters` first adds the Spring Boot configured `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` and then it adds the default `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` from Spring MVC. This causes the `ObjectMapperConfigured` event to fire twice, first for the configured converter (which is actually used) and then for the default converter. So when you f.e. set a custom property naming strategy then in `ObjectMapperBeanPropertyNamingStrategy` this is overwritten by the second event. The following code fixes this:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyWebAutoConfiguration extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void extendMessageConverters(List<HttpMessageConverter<?>> converters) {
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = null;
        for (HttpMessageConverter converter : converters) {
            if (converter instanceof MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter) {
                MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter jacksonConverter =
                        ((MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter) converter);

                if (objectMapper == null) {
                    objectMapper = jacksonConverter.getObjectMapper();
                } else {
                    jacksonConverter.setObjectMapper(objectMapper);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

[[q5]]*Q. How do we use Java 8 types easily. LocalDateTime?*

A. The easiest way to to configure dates is via `Docket#directModelSubstitute(LocalDateTime.class, String.class)`. If
these are ISO 8601 dates that conform to a string format i.e. `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm'Z'`. However you won't have any format or validation info.

TIP: Use `java.sql.Date` works great for date precision and `java.util.Date` for date-time precision footnote:[thanks
 https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1161[@cbronet]]

The way to correctly map the "Date" and "DateTime" types to their corresponding swagger types:

* Substitute "Date" types (java.util.LocalDate, org.joda.time.LocalDate) by java.sql.Date.
* Substitute "DateTime" types (java.util.ZonedDateTime, org.joda.time.LocalDateTime, ...) by java.util.Date.

[source,csharp]
----
docket
.directModelSubstitute(LocalDate.class, java.sql.Date.class)
.directModelSubstitute(LocalDateTime.class, java.util.Date.class)
----



[[q6]]*Q. How does one use `@ModelAttribute` annotation. It doesn't seem to render the model properties as scalar
properties?*

A. In order for `@ModelAttribute` annotated types to be inferred the properties need to be bean properties. If the
intent is immutability and passing in an object, the preferred approach is to make that a request body, in which
case the immutability will follow the rules laid out by jackson to determine what constitutes a request "view" of the
request object.

Getters/setters are a clean way to indicate what values can come in to a operation. While it may not be apparent in a
trivial model with one level nesting; the design choice will become clear when we realize that model attributes can be
arbitrarily nested. Consider (pseudo code in C# for brevity)

[source,csharp]
----

Person {String firstName {get;set;}
String lastName {get;set;}
Category category {get;set;}
Category {String name {get;set;}
String description {get;}

----

So one could set properties:

- firstName
- lastName
- category.name

Now we don't want category to be able to set description via the operation, how do we control/specify that? It makes
it hard to reason about which fields in an object are not intended to be mutated. This is the reason we chose to
limit it to objects that expose getters and setters.

NOTE: I know spring supports fields as well, and it will fall back to fields if setters are not found.

[[q7]]*Q. How should we resolve multiple object mappers available as beans especially when using spring-hateoas?*

A. The idea is to provide a `@Primary` ObjectMapper. Based on answer provided by @prabhat1790 in https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/890[issue #890]

[source,java]
----
  private static final String SPRING_HATEOAS_OBJECT_MAPPER = "_halObjectMapper";

  @Autowired
  @Qualifier(SPRING_HATEOAS_OBJECT_MAPPER)
  private ObjectMapper springHateoasObjectMapper;

  @Primary
  @Bean
  @Order(value=Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)
  @DependsOn(SPRING_HATEOAS_OBJECT_MAPPER)
  public ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
    return springHateoasObjectMapper;
  }
----

and set the order of the other bean to lowest precedence.

[[q8]]*Q. How do I use this library to aggregate swagger-enabled resources from multiple services?*

A. Logical explanation of how one might go about doing this is available in the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/swagger-swaggersocket/multiple/swagger-swaggersocket/g8fgSGUCrYs/A8Ms_lFOoN4J[swagger google
group] Additionally https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1001#issuecomment-147609243[this comment] further
discusses issues with doing this.

[[q9]]*Q. Why are my API params marked as required=false?*

A. This is because of how plugins work and how their priority layers information

- `@PathVariables` are always marked as required.
- `@ApiParam` is an optional annotation to describe additional meta-information like description etc.
- `@ApiParam#required()` is defaulted to false, unless you set it to true.

Springfox uses plugins to layer information. There are a set of plugins that are spring specific that apply the
inferred values on to the internal service models. The swagger annotation related metadata is layered on top of the
spring-mvc descriptions. By definition, plugins don't know and should not know about each other or previously
inferred values (in your case required attribute).

So if you choose to augment the definitions with `@ApiParam` then you need to be explicit and set the value to true.

[[q10]]*Q. How does one write a plugin to e.g. make default all types required and only some not required?*

A. To do this, you'd have to
- add an alternate type rule for `Optional<T>` see `genericModelSubstitutes` in docket
- implement your own https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-spi/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/spi/schema/ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin.java#L26[ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin]
- and override the read only property if you find an `Optional` type. See https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-swagger-common/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/swagger/schema/ApiModelPropertyPropertyBuilder.java#L35[here] for an example.

Keep in mind that you need the plugin to fire after this plugin... so order it accordingly

[[q11]]*Q. Why are all my operations not showing in the UI?*

A. This is a known limitation of swagger-spec. There is a work around for it but, swagger-ui won't play nice with it.
I have a https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/pull/541[PR] which address that issue. Would be great if you vote
up the PR and the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/291[underlying issue]

WARNING: This https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/pull/541[PR] has been closed!

[[q12]]*Q. How would one partition apis based on versions?*

A. Excerpted from an explanation for https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/963[issue 963]...

(springfox) uses the context path as the starting point.

What you really need to is to define a dynamic servlet registration and create 2 dockets .. one for **api** and
one for **api/v2**. This http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23049736/working-with-multiple-dispatcher-servlets-in-a-spring-application[SO post] might help

[source,java]
----
    ...
      Dynamic servlet = servletContext.addServlet("v1Dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(ctx1));
            servlet.addMapping("/api");
            servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);

      Dynamic servlet = servletContext.addServlet("v2Dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(ctx2));
            servlet.addMapping("/api/v2");
            servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);
----

[[q13]]*Q. How does one configure swagger-ui for non-springboot applications?*

A. Excerpted from https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/983[issue 983]...

I was able to get it working by modifying the `dispatcherServlet` to listen on /* , but this prevented `swagger-ui.html`
from being served. To fix this to let the `swagger-ui.html` bypass the `dispatcherServlet` i had to create a new
servlet mapping:

[source,xml]
----
        <servlet>
          <servlet-name>RestServlet</servlet-name>
          <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
          <init-param>
            <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
            <param-value></param-value>
          </init-param>
          <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
        </servlet>

        <servlet-mapping>
          <servlet-name>default</servlet-name>
            <url-pattern>/swagger-ui.html</url-pattern>
        </servlet-mapping>

        <servlet-mapping>
          <servlet-name>RestServlet</servlet-name>
            <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
        </servlet-mapping>
----

Also had to let the webjar through the dispatcher servlet:

`<mvc:resources mapping="/webjars/**" location="classpath:/META-INF/resources/webjars/"/>`

Tricky to get working, but it works.  Perhaps there is a better way to remap swagger-ui.html or let it pass
through the dispatcherServlet.

IMPORTANT: `swagger-ui.html` is the name of the swagger-ui page. While it cannot be changed one can configure the
application such that landing on a particular URL re-directs the browser to the real swagger-ui location.
footnote:[Thanks https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1080#issuecomment-169185653[@chornyi]]

For e.g. One could move Swagger UI under `/documentation` using this code.
[source,java]
----
	@Override
	public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
	
		registry.addRedirectViewController("/documentation/v2/api-docs", "/v2/api-docs?group=restful-api");
        	registry.addRedirectViewController("/documentation/swagger-resources/configuration/ui","/swagger-resources/configuration/ui");
        	registry.addRedirectViewController("/documentation/swagger-resources/configuration/security","/swagger-resources/configuration/security");
        	registry.addRedirectViewController("/documentation/swagger-resources", "/swagger-resources");
	}

	@Override
	public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
	 	registry.
	 		addResourceHandler("/documentation/swagger-ui.html**").addResourceLocations("classpath:/META-INF/resources/swagger-ui.html");
        	registry.
        		addResourceHandler("/documentation/webjars/**").addResourceLocations("classpath:/META-INF/resources/webjars/");
	}
----

However, it still requires a redirect to `/documentation/swagger-ui.html` because the path name is
https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-swagger-ui/src/web/js/springfox.js#L4[hard-coded].

[[q14]]*Q. How does one create rules to substitute list and array items?*

A.  If the following types...

[source,java]
----
    ToSubstitute[] array;
    List<ToSubstitute> list;
----

Need to look like this over the wire...

[source,java]
----
    Substituted[] array;
    List<Substituted> list;
----

This is how the rules need to be configured

[source,java]
----
    rules.add(newRule(resolver.arrayType(ToSubstitute), resolver.arrayType(Substituted)))
    rules.add(newRule(resolver.resolve(List, ToSubstitute), resolver.resolve(List, Substituted)))
----

[[q15]]*Q. How does one configure a docket with multiple protocols/schemes?*

A.  Use the `protocols` method to configure the docket to indicate supported schemes.

[source,java]
----
    docket.protocols(newHashSet("http", "https"))
----


[[q16]]*Q. How does one use springfox in a project with xml spring configuration?*

A. There is a demo application that describes https://github.com/springfox/springfox-demos/tree/master/spring-xml-swagger[how java-xml] configuration needs to be setup.

[[q17]]*Q. How does one override the host name?*

A. This should be available in v2.3 thanks https://github.com/springfox/springfox/pull/1011[to this PR] by @cbornet.
It is still in incubation but host name can be configured per docket

[source,java]
----
     docket.host("http://maybe-an-api-gateway.host");
----

[[q18]]*Q. Infinite loop when springfox tries to determine schema for objects with nested/complex constraints?*

A. If you have recursively defined objects, I would try and see if providing an alternate type might work or perhaps
even ignoring the offending classes e.g. order using the docket. ignoredParameterTypes(Order.class). This is
usually found in Hibernate domain objects that have bidirectional dependencies on other objects.

[[q19]]*Q. How are tags implemented in springfox?*

Tags which are first class constructs just like operations, models etc. and what you see on operations are
references to those Tags. The typical workflow is to register tags in a docket and use the tag definitions on
operations(`@ApiOperation`)/controllers(`@Api`) to point to these registered tags (in the docket) by name.

The convenience we have in place just to reduce the amount of boiler plate for the developer is to provide a default
description that happens to be the same as the tag name. So in effect we are synthesizing a pseudo Tag by referencing
one on the operation.

By defining the Tag on the docket, we are referencing a real tag defined by you.


[[q20]]*20. What can I try if configuration non-boot applications do not work as expected?*

Thanks to https://github.com/Pyohwan[@Pyohwan]'s suggestion
`@Configuration` annotation may not working with @EnableSwagger2.
So shouldn't attach @Configration. So if you have a configuration class that pulls in the springfox configuration
using the `@EnableSwagger2` like below, try removing the `@Configuration` on this class as shown below.

[source,java]
----
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {
...
----

and  use `@Import` annotation on `WebMvcConfigurerAdapter` or similar configuration class.
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
@ComponentScan(...)
@Import(SwaggerConfig.class)
public class MvcConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {
...
----

[[q21]]*21. How to add CORS support? (thanks https://github.com/gangakrishh[@gangakrishh])

Based on the https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/[spring guide], Creating a `WebMvcConfigurer` we can
configure a request mapping to allow specific origins.

[source,java]
----
    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurerAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping("/some-request-mapping").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:9000");
            }
        };
----

If that doesn't work, most likely the cors registration is happening earlier than the SpringFox beans are registered.
 To fix this, we can register a CORS filter registration bean, that registers our endpoints. In the example below,
 we've registered it for all endpoints.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class WebConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

    //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31724994/spring-data-rest-and-cors
    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean corsFilter() {
        UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();

        CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration().applyPermitDefaultValues();
        config.setAllowCredentials(false);
        source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", config);

        FilterRegistrationBean bean = new FilterRegistrationBean(new CorsFilter(source));
        bean.setOrder(0);

        return bean;
    }
}

[[q22]]*22. How to configure the docket when using https://immutables.github.io[Immutables]? (thanks https://github
.com/kevinm416[@kevinm416])

This is related to https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1490[#1490].The way to configure this
is to create a custom  alternateTypeRules in the `Docket` config. For e.g. if you have an immutable `MyClass` that
 generates `ImmutableMyClass`, then we would add a rule for it as shown below.


[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Docket docket() {
  return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
    .alternateTypeRules(AlternateTypeRules.newRule(MyClass.class,
                ImmutableMyClass.class));
----

NOTE: If you're using a library for you models, you may need to make the Immutable visible outside the package.

[[q23]]*23. Why does setting `@ApiImplicitParam#paramType="form"` output undefined dataType?

If you change the datatype to "__file" once 2.7.0 is released, it will fix your issue.

NOTE: The reason we use "__file" is because if a consuming library defines a custom type `File` then that type ends
up getting treated just as if it were a `file` data type, even if that wasn't the intent. To distinguish the usage of
 the custom type from the natively understood `file` primitive we introduced this convention.

[[q24]]
*24. How to configure springfox for Vavr/Javaslang Jackson module support?

We need to first create an alternate type rules convention that tells springfox to treat the vavr persistent
collections just like the native java collections. The following example only configurers Set, List and Map types.
++++
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dilipkrish/2bf80a0285a04b4037c8994fd8cb8b80.js"></script>
++++

Optionally, to use jackson effectively, for non-collection types we can register an application listener that
registers the vavr module with the objectmapper that is being used.
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class SwaggerJacksonModuleWithVavr implements ApplicationListener<ObjectMapperConfigured> {

  @Override
  public void onApplicationEvent(ObjectMapperConfigured event) {
    event.getObjectMapper().registerModule(new VavrModule());
  }
}
----


[[q25]]
*25. Why are properties missing from certain models/types?

A good example of when this might happen is when using Immutables (the library) that are not particularly obvious.
Immutables are great, except that, unless u craft your model correctly it might lead to confusing results, as you've
seen. Also how springfox infers the model is opposite to how the service consumes it. By that I mean that, take for e.g. Model has properties a (read/write), b (write only), c (readonly) we read the writable properties for requests and readable properties for responses.

So if your model is only used for requests, it will have a and b
And if your model is only used of responses it will have a and c
and if it is present in both request and response it will have a, b and c.

We're working to make this better thanks to https://github.com/springfox/springfox/pull/2056[model enhancements work]
 by https://github.com/MaksimOrlov[Maksim]

[[q26]]
*26. Why is `http://host:port/swagger-ui.html` blank? Or why do I get a 404 when I navigate to
`http://host:port/swagger-ui.html`?

In non-spring boot application ensure that the resource handlers are added for the springfox-swagger-ui <<q13,webjars>>

If its a spring boot application:

- check to see if the `spring.resources.add-mappings` property is set to true.
- check to see if spring security is applied that the appropriate resources are permitted.

[source,java]
----
  @Configuration
  public class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
      http
        .csrf().disable()
        .exceptionHandling()
        .authenticationEntryPoint(unauthorizedHandler)
        .accessDeniedHandler(accessDeniedHandler)
        .and()
        .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
        .and()
        .authorizeRequests()
        //.antMatchers("/actuator/**").permitAll()
        .antMatchers("/actuator/**").hasAuthority("ADMIN")
        .antMatchers(
          HttpMethod.GET,
          "/v2/api-docs",
          "/swagger-resources/**",
          "/swagger-ui.html**",
          "/webjars/**",
          "favicon.ico"
        ).permitAll()
        .antMatchers("/auth/**").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated();

      http
        .addFilterBefore(authenticationTokenFilterBean(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
        .headers()
        .cacheControl();
    }
  }
----

Or we could simply ignore these resources altogether

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
    web.ignoring()
      .antMatchers(
        "/v2/api-docs",
        "/swagger-resources/**",
        "/swagger-ui.html**",
        "/webjars/**");
  }
}

*27. Controller receives parameter as a String but we are expecting a json Type. How can we model this?

<1> Assume we have a controller action that has a `String` parameter (contents). This is how we can override the
on-the-wire type (CustomTypeFor2031).
<2> The method parameter that comes in as a `String` that is actually interpreted as `CustomTypeFor2031`
<3> `CustomTypeFor2031` complex type that we read from json String.

Once we do this we need to configure this change so that we can add the model to the definitions section.
